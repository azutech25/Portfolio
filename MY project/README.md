GetYourNumber â€“ A Mobile-Styled Number Guessing Game

*GetYourNumber* is a lightweight and interactive web application where users try to guess a secret number within a limited range. It's built using *HTML, CSS, and JavaScript*, and visually styled to feel like a mobile app interface using GIMP-style assets and layout.

### Features:
- Random number generation on each play
- Dynamic user feedback (Too high, Too low, Correct!)
- Score tracking
- Responsive mobile-like UI design
- Reset and replay functionality

###  Technologies Used:
